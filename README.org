#+TITLE: Oh My Emacs

* Introduction
It is said that Emacs is "a great operating system, lacking only a decent
editor"[1].

Yes, it is, it really is. In fact, Emacs has basic process control and
management, window and frame management(just like windows manager in modern
Linux desktop environment), programming APIs(yeah, elisp to emacs is what
syscall and glibc to Linux), comprehensive manuals and documentation. The only
limitation with Emacs is your imagination.

You can live in Emacs if you like.

But I won't do that, since I want to watch video with mplayer, surf the
Internet with Firefox/Chrome(not with [[http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/][emacs-w3m]]), listen to music with
[[http://amarok.kde.org/][amarok]]. I use Emacs to do what it is good at, namely, text editing. To me,
coding and writing.

This project was born one day I want to reorganize my messy =.emacs.d=. I've
tried all the famous =.emacs.d= projects(such as [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelue]], [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][starter-kit]], etc) but
none of them works the way I want it to.

Then I found [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit][emacs24-starter-kit]], I was deeply attracted by its literate way
to organize and embed elisp code in org-mode files, I wanted to make some
contribution to make it a full-blown hacking environment, but I stopped after
I dived into the code a little, since I want:
- Adapt =el-get= instead of the builtin =package.el=, and
- Have a better completion including =auto-complete= and various =ac-sources=
  projects for various programming languages.

The starter kit projects is just starter's kit, what I want is a full-blown
hacker's kit. So I start my own project, [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]], whose name is inspired
by [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]].

* Features
- Better default settings with various eye candy, powerline, scrollbar,
  color-theme, fonts, etc.
- Adopt =el-get= as the default package manager for Emacs, instead of the
  default builtin =package.el=, say goodbay to =./configure; make; make
  install= and explicitly mananully management of =load-path=. =el-get= also
  provides automatic documentation management, customizable user's recipe
  support, etc.
- Self-adapted, only install necessary packages when it satisfy the
  prerequisities. You need to install [[http://clang.llvm.org/][clang]] for [[https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang][auto-complete-clang]], for
  example.
- Modular, only load necessary packages as you need.
- Literate, each package have comprehensive documentation or even a tiny
  tutorial with it, together with necessary web links. Say goodbye to old,
  out-dated emacs lisp code from Google.
- Work as expected, completion every where when possible, semantic code
  completion through [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-complete]] with various ac backend, [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] for
  minibuffer completion, etc.
- Full-blown, oh-my-emacs is not another starter kit, it is hacker kit.

* Quick Start
Simple enough, ensure you have a good network(Chinese users should get rid of
GFW when possible to avoid many weird problems during first startup), then

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs.git $HOME/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Then just fire up your Emacs and make a coffee, and you should have a
full-blown Emacs OS!

Note that the default oh-my-emacs enabled [[http://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][evil]] by default, you can disable it
globally by =M-x evil-mode=, but I do recommand you enable it and try to
adapt, ah, finally the Emacs OS get a good editor, evil.
