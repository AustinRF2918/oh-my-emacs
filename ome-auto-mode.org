This is part of the [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]].

This file contains various settings for minor file types, such as SCons build
file, archlinux's PKGBUILD file, etc.

* SCons
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: scons
  :END:

[[http://www.scons.org/][SCons]] is a next generation build system that is much easier to configure and
use than the traditional make utility. SCons uses the Python general purpose
programming language as a foundation, and all SCons build files are Python
scripts, so we just set SCons build file work with python-mode.

#+NAME: scons
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("SConstruct" . python-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Puppet
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: puppet
  :END:

[[https://puppetlabs.com/][Puppet]] is configuration management tool from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_Labs][Puppet Labs]], it is the de facto
industry standard for IT automation. Puppet is written by ruby but has its own
DSL, so the emacs builtin =ruby-mode= is not proper for editing puppet files.

#+NAME: puppet
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq el-get-sources
      '((:name puppet-mode)))

(el-get 'sync (mapcar 'el-get-source-name el-get-sources))
#+END_SRC
