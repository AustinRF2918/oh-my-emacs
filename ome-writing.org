[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][Markdown]] is a lightweight markup language, which is very popular as a doc
writing format in many popular open source projects.

[[https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/markdown-pp][markdown-pp]] is a preprocessor for Markdown files to generate a table of
contents and other documentation needs, so I add "mdpp" file to
markdown-mode's auto-mode-alist.
